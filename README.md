<h2>The Tech</h2>




- The program is written in python.
- OpenCV - to achieve a live stream from the web cam to the program. also to build a basic GUI.
- MediaPipe - a Machine learning library. in this project we used the holistic module for basic detections.
- Scikit-learn - a machine learning library. in this project we used it to train our models.


<h2>The program</h2>
<p>To activate and try the program you need to download 'Speaky 0.2v.py', the entire models folder and the main menu. 
<br>
before you run it be sure to:

  
- change the locations in the program (e.g to load the models) to the correct one in your computer.
- install python.
- have a proper IDE.
</p>

<h2>Collect and Build your own</h2>
<p>you can download the 2 files in the 'Collect and Train your own' folder. 
  
- <b>CordsToCsv</b> - with this file you will collect data from your own webcam and export it to a csv file.
- <b>ModelTrain</b> - with this file you will train a model, using the data you collected.
<br>
in both files make sure to change the locations in the program to the correct one in your computer.
